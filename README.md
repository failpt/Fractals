This project is my highschool term paper(yep, we have that at my school) and all the explanations are written in Ukrainian, 
however the code might still be useful for someone. There are also a few links at the end: articles, 
youtube videos and playlists that I used in my work, and that you might also find useful - suit yourself!

There is an actual readme file that is also written in Ukrainian but it was written for people who don't know anything about Jupyter and how to even launch it, 
if you are one of those people I suggest you follow the official instructions and not mine because they will probably only confuse you more, 
since I am also a beginner and this is the fisrt time I ever did something like this and the first time I actually coded on python, 
the only languages I was familiar with before were C#, html, CSS and JavaScript and only the very basics of them. 

Sorry if the content of this readme file is not what you expected it to be, if you have any suggestions or/and advice on how to improve any part of my work - I'm all ears!
